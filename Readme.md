This is a basic login prototype developed in my first year of university. Originally, it stored data temporarily in a List, but Iâ€™ve since enhanced it to permanently save data to a file using Java Streams. At the moment, it securely stores username and password details, with the capability to extend this approach to other data types. My next steps include expanding the prototype to handle additional data and migrating storage to a more robust database solution like JDBC, MySQL, or Firebase. Expect significant updates soon.
